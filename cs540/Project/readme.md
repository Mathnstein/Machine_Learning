# Project Idea

This is a follow-up to a recent project my team had submitted, see [paper](https://github.com/Mathnstein/Machine_Learning/blob/master/cs540/Project/predictive-policing-vancouver.pdf).

Across years, we notice here that there is a spike in almost all types of crime for 2008 and following that a steady decrease in most until another rise in 2013. We do not know the reason for the peak in 2008. Surprisingly neither the Vancouver Olympic Games 2010 nor the Vancouver Stanley Cup riots from 2011 had a significant effect on the number of crimes committed in the year.

Across months, all types of crime seem to be near constant for each month.

![alt_text][typeVday]

Across days, we have that day 31 doesn't happen for ever month so it is noticeably lower in count. Small spikes seem to occur near the middle of the month, but everything is rather uniform. 

![alt_text][typeVhour]

Across hours, we find the most interesting behavior. All types seems to behavior rather erratically with the general trend that crime seems to happen either early morning or late at night.

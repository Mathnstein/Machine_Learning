  # Meeting 6 12/13/17 Wednesday 5pm in Math 125
  
 **(EVERYTHING BELOW IS TEMPORARY)**
 
 **(Possibly final Meeting?)**
  

  ## Prior to the meeting: 

* Worked through Assignment 0's code for calculating gradients in Julia and decision tree + Big O notation questions
* Aim to have read all lecture slides up to **Finding Similar Items** from [CPSC 340](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/340-F17/)
* Glanced at auxillery reads, in particular [K-Means Clustering](https://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/visualizing-k-means-clustering/)
and [K-Means++ video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIQDlmZDuf8) or [DBSCAN code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN)

## Goals for meeting:

* Discuss any topics that weren't clear from the reading
* Write code in Julia for a K-means clustering algorithm with K++
* Try to implement noise (DBSCAN)
* Complete the coding part of [Assignment 1](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/340-F17/a1.pdf)

## Suggestions? 

(Add your own list here, you have my work that I will not look at the edit history)

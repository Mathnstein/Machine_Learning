  # Meeting 3 11/22/17 Wednesday 5pm in Math 125
  
## To Recap...

During our last meeting it became apparant that we need to slow down a bit and remember that research takes prescedence over a reading group. We began working on [assignment 1](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/340-F17/a1.pdf), and realized that we would be much more productive if we went through this a bit more carefully ourselves.

## Before meeting:

* Be caught up on reading up to **Non-parametric models** from [CPSC 340](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/340-F17/)
* Work through [assignment 1](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/340-F17/a1.pdf) and try to have as much of it done as possible, it is very instructive for implementing the theory.
* Let's make this more of a democracy! Edit this file below and state (can be anonymous!):
  - How far you were able to read (no shame for under-reading but props for over-reading :smirk: )
  - How much of the programming you were able to do
  - Things you're interested in talking more about

## What was discussed:

* A bit more of a theoretical discussion of random forests as well as decision trees took place. We were trying to wrap our mind around the size of a random forest given the number of features and data points.
* We worked through the KNN section of assignment 1 together and still have one small error in the plotting of the KNN example. You can find my [notebook](https://github.com/Mathnstein/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Code/Assignment_1_Cody.ipynb) to have everything in it, with answers to sections 1-4.
* Tried to figure out what should be done next or if we should wait for the remaining group members to catch up.

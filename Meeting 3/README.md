  # Meeting 3 11/22/17 Wednesday 5pm in Math 125
  
## To Recap...

During our last meeting it became apparant that we need to slow down a bit and remember that research takes prescedence over a reading group. We began working on [assignment 1](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/340-F17/a1.pdf), and realized that we would be much more productive if we went through this a bit more carefully ourselves.

## Before next meeting:

* Be caught up on reading up to **Non-parametric models** from [CPSC 340](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/340-F17/)
* Work through [assignment 1](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/340-F17/a1.pdf) and try to have as much of it done as possible, it is very instructive for implementing the theory.
* Let's make this more of a democracy! Edit this file below and state (can be anonymous!):
  - How far you were able to read (no shame for under-reading but props for over-reading :smirk: )
  - How much of the programming you were able to do
  - Things you're interested in talking more about

## Edit this!!

(Add your own list here, you have my word that I will not look at the edit history)

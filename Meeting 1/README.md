# Meeting 1

## Prior to the meeting: 

* Aim to have read all lecture slides up to **Probabilistic Classifiers** from [CPSC 340](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/340-F17/)
* Glanced at auxillery reads, in particular [Big O](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/340-F15/notes_BigO.pdf) and [Julia Notes](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/340-F17/juliaCommands.txt)
* Figured out how to access Julia on your terminal: [Remotely](https://next.juliabox.com) or [Locally](https://julialang.org)
* Take a look at the example Julia code (From TUM workshop) [Notebook](https://github.com/Mathnstein/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Meeting%201/julia_basics.ipynb) or [Raw .jl](https://github.com/Mathnstein/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Meeting%201/Julia_basics.jl)

## Goals for meeting:

* Discuss any topics that weren't clear from the reading
* Write code in Julia for forming the best decision tree classifier
* Complete the coding part of [Assignment 0](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/340-F17/a0.pdf)
